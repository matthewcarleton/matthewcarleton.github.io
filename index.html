   </header>
          <p>There are a number of great open source tools for bare metal host provisioning, including Ironic.
          Metal3.io aims to build on these technologies to provide a Kubernetes native API for managing bare
          metal hosts via a provisioning stack that is also running on Kubernetes. We believe that Kubernetes
          Native Infrastructure, or managing your infrastructure just like your applications, is a powerful next
          step in the evolution of infrastructure management.</p>
          <p>The Metal3.io project is also building integration with the Kubernetes cluster-api project, allowing
          Metal3.io to be used as an infrastructure backend for Machine objects from the Cluster API.</p>
